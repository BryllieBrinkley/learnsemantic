<p>Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>) is the standard markup language 
for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style 
Sheets (<abbr>CSS</abbr>) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone 
technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
